# MS3

## Description
The ms3 project is designed to demonstrate advanced techniques in C++ and C programming, combined with efficient build management using CMake. By working through this project, I learned how to:
  * Implement performance-critical code in C++ and C.
  * Use CMake for managing builds and dependencies.
  * Integrate various components to create a cohesive application.
By studying and using this project, I gain hands-on experience with powerful programming languages and tools, enhancing your skills in software development and build automation.

## Built With
* [C++](https://isocpp.org/)
* [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/)

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
* A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++, CLion)
* A C compiler (e.g., gcc, clang, CLion)

### Installing
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/swang308/ms3.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ms3
   ```
3. Create a build directory and navigate into it:
   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   ```
4. Generate the build files using CMake:
   ```bash
   cmake ..
   ```
5. Build the project:
   ```bash
